## API Usage

The application exposes a RESTful API for warehouse proximity calculations.

**Base Endpoint:** `/api/v1/warehouses/proximity`

### Example Request

```http
POST https://warehouse-proximity.onrender.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "warehouse": [14.5995, 120.9842],
  "delivery": [14.6000, 120.9850],
  "radius": 250
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "distance": 102.42,
  "within_range": true
}
```

## Deployment Details

- **Live Production Deployment:**  
  The latest version of this service is deployed and available at:  
  ðŸ‘‰ [https://warehouse-proximity.onrender.com](https://warehouse-proximity.onrender.com)

- **Local Deployment:**  
  Run the API locally for development:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

## Integration (Backend to Frontend)

The official frontend for this API is the [logistics-dashboard](https://github.com/MikhailAquino/logistics-dashboard), built with Laravel.

- The frontend offers an intuitive interface for users to input delivery coordinates, define search radius, and visually explore warehouse proximity on an interactive map.
- The backend (this API) is live on Render, and the frontend is configured to interact with it via the Render deployment endpoint, set in the frontendâ€™s `.env` or relevant configuration files.
- All data exchange between frontend and backend is handled via RESTful JSON API calls, ensuring smooth and secure integration.
